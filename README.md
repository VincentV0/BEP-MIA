### Hyperparameter optimization in a brachial plexus classification problem 
##### _Bachelor End Project of Vincent Vousten at the Eindhoven University of Technology_
This repository contains the code files for the Bachelor End Project of Vincent Vousten at the Eindhoven University of Technology. This project is focussed on the classification of the brachial plexus from ultrasound images. The dataset is found in a [Kaggle competition](http://kaggle.com/c/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation/)

`CNN.py` is the main file, from which functions in `CNN_utils.py`, `data.py` and `data_augmentation.py` are called. For reproducability, the text file `used_python_packages.txt` contains all the Python packages and its versions that were installed on the used system (list aquired using `pip freeze`). 

The changelog can be found [here](changelog.md).
